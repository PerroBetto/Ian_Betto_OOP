"""
Game Module

> Contains the Game singleton manager for everything within the game.

As per the tutorial online, a game loop should look like this:

>>> while True:
>>>     event()
>>>     loop()
>>>     render()
>>>     sound()

We handle events first, then run the next game loop (next frame)
and then render the game to the screen last.

RULES:
    Screen is 1440 by 810
    All images should be scaled up by a factor of 5
